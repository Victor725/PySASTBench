# PySASTBench
In 《Empirical Evaluation of Python SAST Tools: Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Improvement Directions》, we present a dataset designed for evaluating Python SAST Tools. 

This dataset consists of 71 unique Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), providing a valuable resource for benchmarking. 

Using this dataset, we conducted a large scale empirical evaluation of five state-of-the-art Python SAST Tools, examining their effectiveness and efficiency.
